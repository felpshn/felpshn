My journey in programming started in the middle of 2019, I was on YouTube and saw a video related to a Python course of the incredible professor Gustavo Guanabara â€” it is to him to whom I owe my journey in programming since then â€” after watching the intro video, I got so interested that I dove into the whole course. After finishing it, I was so excited about this whole new universe, that I keep moving on and never stopped learning since.
